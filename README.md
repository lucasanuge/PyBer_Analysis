## Summary
From our analysis, Urban cities by far has the highest total weekly fares, followed by Suburban and Rural cities. Because of this, we can suggest increasing drivers in Urban cities to decrease fares and hence attacting more customers in using PyBer services. We can also suggest closing our services in rural areas as total weekly fares are surprisingly low and may have used more resources in maintaining services in rural areas than the resources given back from those services. And laslty, we can suggest focus more towards expanding our services in Suburban cities by mainting driver count in Suburban cities.
